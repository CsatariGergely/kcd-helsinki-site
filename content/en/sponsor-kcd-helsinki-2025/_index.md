## What is this?

We’re organizing the first-ever Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) conference in Helsinki, and it’s happening on
**May 6, 2025**, in **Helsinki**! This event is part of the global KCD program, supported by the Cloud Native Computing
Foundation (CNCF), and is a big step forward in building a stronger cloud-native community here in Finland. Our
inclusion in the program has been officially announced [here](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/10/30/mark-your-calendars-here-come-the-2025-kubernetes-community-days/).

Kubernetes and cloud native technologies are core to what we do, so this feels like the perfect opportunity
to bring the community together to share ideas and learn from each other. We’ve also set up a non-profit association,
Cloud Native Finland ry, to ensure the event stays community-driven and transparent.
